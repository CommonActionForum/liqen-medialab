The liQen Project seeks to build a prototype for a collaborative web and mobile app that will allow citizens to push data collected to signal environmental problems in their city, including garbage issues, acoustic pollution, visual pollution, atmospheric pollution etc. The app will represent environmental conflicts in the city and add crowdsourced data to the local open databases, with the possibility of amending, editing or replacing already existing data. As an important innovation, citizens will receive real-time feedback to ascertain whether the information collected already exists in the database.

Our prototype to be presented at [Visualizar 2016](http://medialab-prado.es/visualizar) will deploy during the event applying our technology within the complex socio-technical environment in Madrid, which includes a community of civic hackers, the local government, and important possibilities to reach out to users/testers. The pilot experience and results will be exploited towards the utilization of liQen in other cities, mainly Santiago de Chile and London.
