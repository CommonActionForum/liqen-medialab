LiQen Project seeks to collect qualitative data from citizens crowdsourced using web and mobile apps aim to discover territorial controversies among cities in the world.

At the moment we have created a prototype which have been presented at [Visualizar 2016](http://medialab-prado.es/visualizar), where we are comparing noise pollution data from [smart citizen](#) environmental sensor network with data harvested for volunteers in three different cities: London, Madrid and Santiago.

Our results will be presented on a data visualization showing a comparision between a quantitative measure (sensors) and a qualitative perspective (volunteers). Also, as an inmersive experience we included the level of sound for each city, to deliver a more emotional relationship with the data.
